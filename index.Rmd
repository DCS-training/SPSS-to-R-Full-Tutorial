# Introduction

This Tutorial will help you performing statistical analysis and visualisation task that you would normally perform with SPSS in R.

## Benefits of using R vs SPSS
- R is an open source language freely usable by everyone
- R has a quite wide range of functions and statistical models
- R is very powerful when it comes to produce data visualisation (and highly customisable)
- RMarkdown will allow you to create your own reproducible, customisable, and interactive analysis reports that can be shared and will make your research fully reproducible

## Tutorial Aims

### Section 1:
-   Learn how to download and run R studio.
-   Learn how navigate the basics of R.
-   Learn data manipulation in R.

## Section 1 

### Tools

#### R, RStudio, and RMarkdown

**R** is a programming language and software environment primarily used for statistical computing and data analysis. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, making it a popular choice among statisticians, data analysts, and researchers. You can manipulate and analyse data using simply R but these tasks are much easier when using it is most popular user-friendly interface **R Studio**

**R Studio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that enhances the user experience by providing a user-friendly interface, tools for plotting, debugging, and workspace management. 

**R Markdown** is an authoring format that enables users to create dynamic documents, reports, and presentations directly from R. It combines the power of R with the flexibility of Markdown, allowing for the integration of code, results, and narrative text in a single document. R Markdown documents can be rendered to various formats, including HTML, PDF, and Word 
**Markdown** is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Getting started

The first thing you need to do is getting set up in R Studio. There are two options to do, i.e. you can download the software and run it locally on your PC or you can access R Studio online. 

Setting up online is on average easier but it will entail uploading your data online.

### Set up Locally with R Studio


- R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. Follow the instructions below for your operating system

_Windows_

  - Download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
  - Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
  - Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
  - Under _Installers_ select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows ... ** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
  - Double click the file to install it
  - Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.

_macOS_

  - Download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
  - Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
  - Double-click on the downloaded file to install R
  - It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed by some packages)
  - Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
  - Under _Installers_ select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X ... (64-bit)** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
  - Double-click the file to install RStudio
  - Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.

_Linux_

  - Follow the instructions for your distribution from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.5.1.
  - Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
  - Under _Installers_ select the version that matches your distribution, and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
  - Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

### Access R Studio Online

Different institutions would have their own cloud-based computational notebook services that will allow you to run your code online (e.g. https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/ for The University of Edinburgh)but these services are normally available only for staff and students. 
If your institution does not have their own service you can use the cloud-based server at https://posit.co/. The basic version is free but you will have a limitation on the number of projects and collaborators you can have.

1. Go to https://posit.cloud/
2. Signup either via Gmail or GitHub
3. Go on New Project
4. New RStudio Project


## The RStudio Interface

The R studio interface has four windows: **the Console**, **the Source**, **Environment / History / Connections / Tutorial** and  the **Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer**. 

Below you can find a quick explanation of what each windows contains. For a full overview of the R studio interface see https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/the-rstudio-interface.html 

![Rstudio Interface](ImagesTutorial/RstudioInterface.png)

### The Console Window

Located in the bottom left, this is where you normally see the result of the code (but if you are using RMarkdown documents you will see the code running under each chuck of code as well). You can run code directly in here but you will normally do it from the **Source** window instead. 

### The Source Window 

Located in the top left, this is where you are going to write your code and open any files you want to work on. If you are going to use RMarkdown, you can magnify this window and ignore any other windows except maybe the ***Environment** one because you are going to see the output of your code under each chunk

### The Environment / History / Connections / Tutorial Window

Located on the top right, this windows contains a series of sub-windows Environment, history, Connections, Git, and Tutorial. 

In ***Environment** you are going to see all object that you will create in the R Studio Environment, from the dataset you will import to the variable you will create. Once you have create an object you can visualise it by double-clicking on it. On the top ribbon you can also see an icon ""Import Dataset" that will allow you to select the dataset you want to import into R. If you click on it and then in From Text(readr) you can navigate to where you dataset is 

![Import Dataset ](ImagesTutorial/import-dataset.png)
If you click on it and then in From Text(readr) you can navigate to where you dataset is. 


*Reproducibility Trick* - instead of pressing Import copy and paste the bit of code that you see under Code Preview into your script (and make sure that the file will be on the same folder of the script). In this way everyone will be able to replicate your steps.
![Import Dataset ](ImagesTutorial/Readr.png)
In the **History** tab you will see all the computations you will perform in the Console. 

In the **Connections** tab you can connect to external databases.

In the **Git** tab you can manage your work if you are working with Version Control (more on setting up with Git and GitHub in RStudio https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github).

In the **Tutorial** tab you can find more tutorials and material to learn R and R Studio.

### The Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer Window 
 
The bottom right windows will allows you see and open files, visualise the plots you will create, visually install and load packages (for reproducibility is always better to do it from the source code), get help about the functions and packages, visualise non static images (viewer), and visualise your presentation (if you are using Quarto https://quarto.org/). 


## Working with RMarkdown

 As we said before R Markdown is a specific type of file format designed to produce documents that include both code and text.
It allows you to simultaneously 

1: save and execute code, and 

2: produce high quality documents that include both code and text

### Create a new markdown file

- Go on File> New File> RMarkdown
- Decide the Title, the Author and what format you want to use for the export (html, pdf, Word) and press OK
![New Rmarkdown ](ImagesTutorial/new_rm2.png)
- It will open a draft file that you can modify and populate with more code 
- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk, text and even images. To run the code, click the small green arrow in the code chunk, or press `ctrl` + `enter` together.

For a more in depth overview on how to get set and create RMarkdown files see https://intro2r.com/rmarkdown_r.html and https://github.com/DCS-training/Interactive-Analysis-Reports-with-R-Markdown.github.io 

### Importing material from a GitHub Repository

- **On Posit**
  - Go on New Project from Git Repository
  - Copy and Paste this repository URL: https://github.com/DCS-training/From-SPSS-to-R-How-to-Make-Your-Statistical-Analysis-Reproducible as the Repository URL
  - The Project directory name will filled in automatically
  - Navigate to the rmd file you want to explore

- ***On Noteable and Locally**
  - Go to File >New Project>Version Control>Git
  - Copy and Paste this repository URL: https://github.com/DCS-training/From-SPSS-to-R-How-to-Make-Your-Statistical-Analysis-Reproducible as the Repository URL
  - The Project directory name will filled in automatically but you can change it if you want your folder in Notable to have a different name
  - Navigate to the rmd file you want to explore

## Starting working with R and R Studio 

Now that we are all set up let's start exploring what we can do with R and RStudio. 
If you want to explore the basics of R and R studio more you can have a look to this introductory video [introductory video](https://media.ed.ac.uk/media/CDCS%20Text%20%26%20Data%20Analysis%20Summer%20School%202022%20-%20Intro%20to%20R%20and%20R%20Studio/1_3usrqpmj).

For anyone who want access to a useful resource to continue working through R, I recommend the [Pirates's](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/t-test-t-test.html) guide to **RRRRRR**.

Please note that there are multiple ways to conduct our analyses in R. So don't be afraid if you've come across something different in the past. Just use the method you find that works best for you.


**To run the code, click the small green arrow in the code chunk, or press `ctrl` + `enter` together.**

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
